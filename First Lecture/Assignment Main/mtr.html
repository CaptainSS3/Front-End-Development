    <p> Meet the Robinsons is a 2007 American computer-animated science-fiction comedy film produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.
         The 47th animated film produced by the studio, it is loosely based on the 1990 children's book A Day with Wilbur Robinson by William Joyce. 
         The film follows the interactions between Lewis, an orphaned 12-year-old inventor desperate to be adopted, 
         and Wilbur Robinson, a young time-traveler who is trying to prevent a mysterious bowler-hatted man from changing Lewis' story, 
         and, by proxy, the entire future.
        Directed by Stephen Anderson, the film's voice cast includes Anderson, Daniel Hansen, Jordan Fry, Wesley Singerman, Angela Bassett, Tom Selleck, Harland Williams, 
        Laurie Metcalf, Nicole Sullivan, Adam West, Ethan Sandler, and Tom Kenny. 
        Meet the Robinsons was released in standard and Disney Digital 3-D versions on March 23, 2007 in the United Kingdom and March 30, 2007 in the United States. </p>
