    <p>The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the earlier film of the same name. 
        It is based on the belief of the pseudoscientific law of attraction, which claims that thoughts can change a person's life directly.
         The book alleges energy as assurance of its effectiveness. The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages. 
        Scientific claims made in the book have been rejected by a range of critics, pointing out that the book has no scientific foundation.</p>
