            <p>The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the earlier film of the same name. <br>
                It is based on the belief of the pseudoscientific law of attraction, which claims that thoughts can change a person's life directly. <br>
                 The book alleges energy as assurance of its effectiveness. <br> The book has sold 30 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 50 languages.  <br>
                Scientific claims made in the book have been rejected by a range of critics, pointing out that the book has no scientific foundation.</p>
