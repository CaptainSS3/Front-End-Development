    <p> Fences is a 2016 American period drama film starring, produced and directed by Denzel Washington and written by August Wilson,
         based on his Pulitzer Prize-winning 1985 play of the same name. Wilson was in Pittsburgh, 
         Pennsylvania, and originally wanted to pursue being a poet, but later found passion for being a playwright.
         In addition to Washington, 
         the film also stars Viola Davis, 
         Stephen McKinley Henderson, Jovan Adepo, 
         Russell Hornsby, Mykelti Williamson, and Saniyya Sidney.

        Principal photography took place from April 25 to June 14,
         2016, in the Hill District of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
        
        Fences was released in North America on December 16, 
        2016, by Paramount Pictures. 
        It received positive reviews and praise from critics towards Washington's performance and direction,
         Davis's performance, the screenplay, pacing, cinematography and emotional tone. 
         Critics found the film "extremely powerful and effective." It was a commercial success, 
         grossing $64 million against a $24 million production budget.
        
        The film was chosen by the American Film Institute as one of the top ten films of 2016,
         and was nominated for numerous awards, including four Oscar nominations at the 89th Academy Awards: Best Picture, 
         Best Actor (Washington), Best Supporting Actress (Davis) and Best Adapted Screenplay, 
         with Davis winning for her performance. 
         It also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor for Washington and a Best Supporting Actress win for Davis.</p>
